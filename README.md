# E-commerce-Platforms-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing four major e-commerce platforms—**Tokopedia, Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok**—to gain insights into their **revenue**, **promotion ratio**, and **cancellation ratio**. The analysis aims to evaluate the performance of these platforms and provide recommendations for new sellers regarding the most suitable platform for their products and strategies to minimize cancellations.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the dataset.
- **Power BI**: For visualizing performance metrics and drawing actionable insights.

## SQL Queries
Seven SQL queries have been executed in this project:
1. Quantity sold per platform: Retrieves the total quantity of items sold for each platform
2. Sales performance (revenue, orders, items sold, AOV, ASP) by platform in May 2024: Calculates sales performance metrics (Revenue, Orders, Items Sold, AOV, ASP) for each platform in May 2024, excluding canceled, returned, and failed orders.
3. Top 5 revenue-generating product SKUs in May 2024: Lists the top 5 Product SKUs that generated the highest revenue in May 2024, excluding canceled, returned, and failed orders.
4. First date each product SKU was sold: Finds the earliest date that each Product SKU was sold.
5. Seller promotion ratio by product category: Calculates the seller promotion ratio (promotion value divided by revenue) for each product category.
6. Product SKU with the highest cancellation ratio in June 2024 and the reason for cancellation: Identifies the Product SKU with the highest cancellation ratio in June 2024 and provides the primary reason for the cancellations.
7. Late delivery rate for Shopee and Lazada: Calculates the percentage of late deliveries (delivered 3+ days after the order) for Shopee and Lazada.

## Power BI Dashboard
Using Power BI, an overview dashboard was created to visualize the performance of the four platforms. The dashboard provides insights on:
- Which platform is most suitable for new sellers.
- Suggested strategies to reduce the cancellation ratio. 

The findings from this analysis help new sellers decide which platform to prioritize and what steps to take to improve their sales outcomes.
